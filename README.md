# Algorithm-Project


first Algorithm is Greatest number from imput number.

second Algorithm is Bullbs.








# Discriptions:

FIRST ALGORITHM GREATEST NUMBER

User put chain of numbers and algorithm check every single number from chain and order it in descending order to return greatest possible number.
E.G. 2435 solution 5432.

SECOND ALGORITHM BULBS

User put chain of numbers in order to which bullb may turn on. And it turn on only when every bullbs before it is turn on too. Algorithm return the number of how many times bullbs was turn on.
E.G. A[9] = { 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 8, 9, 7 } solution is 4.
light turn on on bullb number 1, 3, 4, 7.
